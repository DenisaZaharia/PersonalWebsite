        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Wishing to provide people with better socialising options post
          COVID-19, 4 students from Fontys University of Applied sciences teamed
          up, and created an unique concept, that focuses on connecting people
          based on shared interests, not taking into account physical aspect.

        <h1>Why connectYall?</h1>
        <p>
          Due to lockdowns and restrictions, people became more isolated and
          many previously common activities started to feel out of place, even
          developing social anxiety for some people. For international students
          like most of us, socialising and finding friends with the same
          interests as us was even harder, as online education was still
          happening and social activities were not yet organised. connectYall
          comes in help to those people who wish to bond over mutual interests,
          without the pressure of looking good at all times or useless small
          conversation - you can skip directly to what you enjoy doing!

        <h1>Branding</h1>
        <p>
          It’s always tough coming up with a name for a website, there aren’t
          many domain names left so we used a great little tool called Lean
          Domain Search to come up with a suitable name with an available
          domain. The name needed to be short, easy to say and spell, and also
          needed to convey what the actual website was for. After throwing a
          bunch of ideas around, we combined the words “connect” and “everyone”
          to come up with “ConnectYall"

          After doing a quick round of guerilla research, we were able to define
          if our difficulties with socialisation post COVID-19 were the case for
          other people too, and if so to identify a target audience for which we
          were able to identify their goals and needs. After finalizing an idea,
          our next step was to create wireframes, as having a design
          representation in our mind would not help us that much.

        <p>
          We started our visualisation for our product by choosing a colour
          palette. Wanting to induce a feeling of friendliness and joy to our
          users, as well as the feeling of safety and calmness, we came up with
          this colour palette for our application and our promotional products.
